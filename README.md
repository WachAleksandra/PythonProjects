## Longest Common Subsequence
Algorithm used to determine the longest common subsequence, in which the program reads successive lines from two files as input strings. File names are given as program invocation parameters. The program finds and prints the longest common subsequence and its length. In addition, it shows the differences between the input strings and compares the successive lines of text files for identity and colors them depending on the result.

## Dijkstra's algorithm
Algorithm that finds the nearest path in a weighted directed graph for a given pair of vertices: the initial and the final one.
The algorithm finds the length of the shortest path (the sum of the weights of its edges) and the path itself (the sequence of vertices through which this path runs). The algorithm returns the appropriate information if there is no path from the given start vertex to the end vertex. The program reads a graph from a text file. Also, program draws a graph and marks the course of the shortest path on it. The graph is saved to a png file.
