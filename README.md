## Longest Common Subsequence
Algorithm of the longest common subsequence, where the program reads successive lines from two files as input strings. File names are given as program invocation parameters. The program finds and prints the longest common subsequence and its length. In addition, it shows the differences between the input strings and compares the successive lines of text files for identity and colors them depending on the result.
